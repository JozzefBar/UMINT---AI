## Installation üì•

To run the projects, you need to have **Matlab** installed. **Matlab version 2024b** was used during creation

1. Download and install [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) .
2. Download necessary Toolboxes.

		Computer Vision Toolbox
		Deep Learning Toolbox
		Fuzzy Logic Toolbox
		Optimization Toolbox

3. Download opational Toolboxe *(for better workspace)*

   		New Desktop for MATLAB Tech Preview
     
5. Clone this repository.
6. Open Matlab, navigate to the directory where this repository is stored.

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

Each project includes separate scripts and functions, which can be executed directly in the Matlab environment. The scripts are labeled with the assignment names and can be run directly from Matlab.

To run the tasks, follow these steps: 
1. Open **Matlab**. 
2. Navigate to the directory where the files are stored using the Matlab file explorer. 
3. Add the necessary functions to the Matlab path
4. Run the main program *(usually named cviko+sth. or programy_ulohyXX)*

## Assignments üìÑ

All assignments are in file [seminar](seminar/).

For assignments `1 - 4`, `5 - 8` and `9`, there is a separate PDF with images and detailed descriptions. Additionally, lecture PDFs contain theoretical explanations of the tasks. *(But in **Slovak Language!**)*

### Assignment 1Ô∏è‚É£

-   Mark the final result with a unique color.

**Bonus:**
-   Implement a **stochastic hill-climbing algorithm**.
